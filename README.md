##Libraries Used

- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
- [jQuery Impromptu](https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Impromptu) for modal resizing window
- [Jcrop](https://github.com/tapmodo/Jcrop) to crop the images
- [File Uploader](http://github.com/valums/file-uploader) to upload images

##Usage

**THIS example is not for production use.  It is only an example implementation!**

Please see examples provided.  These are minimal examples.  All scripts included are needed.

To use the examples you MUST give the upload directories write permissions.

There is a bit of resizing and crop work to be done on your part, this is just an 
example of how to get the script croordinating with fileuploader, Impromptu, and jcrop.

When you begin your own implementation you will need to do some image prep work in 
upload.php, as well as crop.php (or whereever you decide to place it.)
